## Hi there

<Portrait />

_I am an experienced software engineer who specializes in helping teams develop user-friendly, maintainable client-side applications._

I have over seven years of professional experience as an engineer, and I am the maintainer of several successful open source projects. I am also an experienced social scientist with a master's degree in social psychology.

## Open Source

I maintain several successful open source projects. With a distributed group of people, I have developed software that has millions of downloads per year and tens of thousands of monthly users.

Below you will find just a small selection of well-known users of my software:

- [metalsmith](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith) is used by: Mozilla, The W3C, The Node.js Project, LinkedIn, Adobe, NBC News, Harvard University, Cornell University, The UK Government Digital Service, The US Government's Department of Veterans Affairs and The World Bank.

## Social Psychology

People are a critical part of everything we do as software engineers. My background in the social sciences allows me to provide an expert's perspective on all matters related to psychology. I can assist organizations in changing organizational processes and can help teams truly understand the needs of their users.

As a skilled researcher, I am able to guide teams to solutions based on verifiable evidence, backed by data. By employing the scientific method, decisions will be unbiased and realistic.
